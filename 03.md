> What resource does this controller give access to?
- Is it ok if I donâ€™t write a test for this?
> What will happen when we need to change this code later?
- Which ORM is the best one for me to use on this product?
> What are the strengths of the ORMs you are considering
- What color do I make this button?
- Which callback should I use here?
