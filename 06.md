# Secret  6: Successful Mentors: Replay their reactions____________________________

Think about some feedback you recently received. Describe the feeback in as much detail as you can remember.
This code is Janky, but it's janky in a location that make it clear where we need to update it later.

Answer these three questions about the feedback.

- Was the feedback clear or opaque?
Clear
- Was it immediate or delayed?
delayed
- How did the feedback make you feel?
confident

The brain can shut down when you get critical feelback.
Example, kid grabbing glasses; why was I getting so upset? Childhood experience wearing glasses. Catch that response and replay it.
- Use phrase: "This is how that came across for me"
- If you can't say anything nice, say something about yourself.

|Instead of ...                                  | Try ...                              |
|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Can I give you some feedback?                  |Here's my reaction...                 |
| Good job! (I am the arbitor of good)           |I like what you did here; this works for me|
| Here’s what you should do.                     |Here's what I would do.               |
| That won’t really work.                        |Replay your reaction (I was confused) |
| You need to improve your communication skills. |I'm having a hard time understanding X; include where they lost you.|
| You are slow to complete you work              |How does it make you feel? I'm concerned we won't meet our goals|
| You spin your wheels for too long before asking for help.|                            |

Rewrite that actual feeback your received imagining the feedback giver replaying their reactions to you.
