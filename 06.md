## Secret  6: Successful Mentors:___________________________________________________

### Think about some feedback you recently received. Describe the feeback in as much detail as you can remember.

### Anser these three questions about the feedback. 
  - Was the feedback clear or opaque?
  - Was it immediate or delayed?
  - How did the feedback make you feel?


|Instead of ...                                  | Try ...                              |
|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Can I give you some feedback?                  |                                      |
| Good job!                                      |                                      |
| Here’s what you should do.                     |                                      |
| That won’t really work.                        |                                      |
| You need to improve your communication skills. |                                      |
| You are slow to complete you work              |                                      |
| You spin your wheels for too long before asking for help.|                            |

### Rewrite that actual feeback your received imagining the feedback giver replaying their reactions to you.
