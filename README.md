# Workshop Template

This readme lays out out a consistent structure for RailsConf workshops to follow.  We recommend you use this readme to seed your workshop's repo.  Fill in the sections below as appropriate for your workshop.

# <Workshop Name>
 
Include the description for your workshop.  Typically this would be the same description that you have for the program page.  We do recommend you make it clear this is part of the conference and link back to the conference program page.  A good description should include what will the workshop cover, what will the attendees get out of the workshop, and generally the expected skill level targeted.

For RailsConf 2021, you'll want to link to the Discord channels that will be used.

## Prerequisites

This section should list out whatever is required by attendees to successfully participate in the workshop.  This is important in case they realize they can't fulfill those and thus should reconsider attending.


## Getting Ready

This section includes the steps an attendee should take to get fully prepared for the start of the workshop.  If the workshop will be executing code from a starting app, I'd expect any installation steps to get up and running.  If there is any homework before the start, list that out.
